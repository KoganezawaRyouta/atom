Move `zsh/wild-cherry.zsh-theme` file to [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/)'s theme folder: `oh-my-zsh/themes/wild-cherry`.\n2. Go to your `~/.zshrc` file and set `ZSH_THEME=\"wild-cherry\"`. Finally, reload your terminal.\n\n\n##iTerm\n\n**Activating...**\n\n1. *iTerm2 → `Preferences` → `Profiles` → `Colors` Tab*\n2. Click *`Load Presets...`*\n3. Click *`Import...`*\n4. Select the `iterm/wild-cherry.itermcolors` file\n5. Select the *`wild cherry`* from *`Load Presets...`*\n\n\n##Sublime\n\n![Sublime Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mashaal/wild-cherry/master/images/sublime.png)\n\n* This is a customized version of the [Cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2) UI.\n* Massive thanks to [ctf0](https://github.com/ctf0) for his help! :tophat:\n\n**Package Control**\n\n1. Open package control `tools` → `Command Palette` and type `Install Package`\n2. Search for `Wild Cherry` and hit enter\n3. Lastly, open `Preferences` → `Settings - User`. Add the following two lines:\n\n```\n\"theme\": \"wild-cherry.sublime-theme\",\n\"color_scheme\": \"Packages/Wild Cherry/wild-cherry.tmTheme\"\n```\n`color_scheme` defines how the code looks and `theme` defines how the sidebar, tabs, search, command palette work. \n\n##Atom\n\n![Atom Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mashaal/wild-cherry/master/images/atom.jpg)\n\nI've used Atom's theme converter to convert the syntax theme- which is now added to this repository. \n\nUnfortunately, I do not know how easy it is to convert the UI? (not hugely familiar with Atom.) **HELP!** :see_no_evil:\n\n##Future? :crystal_ball:\n\nWant to give the princess a makeover? :lipstick: Fork- and submit a pull request! :ribbon:\n\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mashaal/wild-cherry/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mashaal/wild-cherry","_id":"Wild-Cherry@0.4.0","_shasum":"f3b2879f44c7821fbf7d0e1bfee7a46a7a78a6b1","_resolved":"file:../d-115218-79154-14w9kgo/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115218-79154-14w9kgo/package.tgz"}
